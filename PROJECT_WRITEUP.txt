Banking Customer Support AI Agent - Project Writeup

When beginning this project, I evaluated several architectural approaches for building an AI-powered customer support system. I considered a simple linear pipeline, a rule-based routing system, and a graph-based state machine architecture. After weighing the trade-offs, I chose LangGraph's StateGraph framework because it provided the flexibility to implement conditional routing based on classification confidence while maintaining clean separation between components. This architecture allowed me to route messages through different handlers (positive feedback, negative feedback, queries, and escalation) based on both the classification type and confidence score, ensuring uncertain messages are escalated to human agents rather than receiving potentially incorrect automated responses.

I implemented the project in phases, starting with the database layer using SQLAlchemy to define schemas for support tickets, interaction logs, and session history. This foundation enabled persistent storage and retrieval of customer interactions throughout the workflow. Next, I built the core workflow in workflow.py, implementing input validation, LLM-based message classification using structured outputs, and specialized handler agents for each message type. Each agent was designed with a specific responsibility: the NegativeFeedbackAgent creates support tickets, the QueryAgent performs ticket lookups, and the EscalationAgent handles low-confidence cases. After the backend was complete, I connected a Streamlit UI with a dark green and cream theme, providing a clean interface for submitting messages and viewing classification results, confidence scores, and response details. Finally, I created a comprehensive test suite with 55 labeled test cases covering positive feedback, negative feedback, queries, and edge cases, achieving 100% classification accuracy and validating that the routing logic correctly escalates ambiguous inputs.
